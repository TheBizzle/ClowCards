## ClowCards

A browser-based Heroscape card random-drafter.  To use, just supply a list of the players and the number of cards that each player should get.  Each card in the pool is selected at most once.  Without restarting the application, cards can have their draftability toggled, for minor customization of the cardset.

__Note__: Some cards are revised or renamed versions of official cards, and some others are entirely custom-made.  Usefulness to third parties may vary.  To appropriate the cardset to meet your needs, it shouldn't be too hard to customize the `/app/assets/javascripts/index/cards.coffee` file to properly represent your own cardset.
